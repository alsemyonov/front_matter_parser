# FrontMatterParser

FrontMatterParser is a library to parse a front matter from strings or files.
It allows writing syntactically correct source files, marking front matters as
comments in the source file language.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'front_matter_parser'

or, to get the development version:

    gem 'front_matter_parser', github: 'waiting-for-dev/front_matter_parser'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install front_matter_parser

## Usage

Front matters must be between two lines with three dashes `---`.

Given a file `example.md`:

```md
---
title: Hello World
category: Greetings
---
Some actual content
```

You can parse it:

```ruby
parsed = FrontMatterParser::Parser.parse_file('example.md')
parsed.front_matter #=> {'title' => 'Hello World', 'category' => 'Greetings'}
parsed.content #=> 'Some actual content'
```

You can directly apply `[]` method to get a front matter value:

```ruby
parsed['category'] #=> 'Greetings'
```

### Syntax autodetection

`FrontMatterParser` detects the syntax of a file by its extension and it supposes that the front matter is within that syntax comments delimiters.

Given a file `example.haml`:

```haml
-#
   ---
   title: Hello
   ---
Content
```

The `-#` and the indentation enclose the front matter as a comment. `FrontMatterParser` is aware of that, so you can simply do:

```ruby
title = FrontMatterParser::Parser.parse_file('example.haml')['title'] #=> 'Hello'
```

Following there is a relation of known syntaxes and their known comment delimiters:

<pre>
| Syntax | Single line comment | Start multiline comment | End multiline comment  |
| ------ | ------------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------- |
| haml   |                     | -#                      | (indentation)          |
| slim   |                     | /                       | (indentation)          |
| liquid |                     | {% comment %}           | {% endcomment %}       |
| md     |                     |                         |                        |
| html   |                     | &lt;!--                    | --&gt;                    |
| erb    |                     | &lt;%#                     | %&gt;                     |
| coffee | #                   |                         |                        |
| sass   | //                  |                         |                        |
| scss   | //                  |                         |                        |
</pre>

### Parsing a string

You can as well parse a string, providing manually the `syntax`:

```ruby
string = File.read('example.slim')
FrontMatterParser::Parser.new(:slim).parse(string)
```

### Custom parsers

You can implement your own parsers for other syntaxes. Most of the times, they will need to parse a syntax with single line comments, multi line comments or closed by indentation comments. For these cases, this library provides helper factory methods. For example, if they weren't already implemented, you could do something like:

```ruby
SlimParser = FrontMatterParser::SyntaxParser::IndentationComment['/']
CoffeeParser = FrontMatterParser::SyntaxParser::SingleLineComment['#']
Html = FrontMatterParser::SyntaxParser::MultiLineComment['<!--', '-->']
```

You would use them like this:

```ruby
slim_parser = SlimParser.new

# For a file
FrontMatterParser::Parser.parse_file('example.slim', syntax_parser: slim_parser)

# For a string
FrontMatterParser::Parser.new(slim_parser).parse(string)
```

For more complex scenarios, a parser can be anything responding to `call(string)` which needs to respond a hash interface with `:front_matter` and `:content` keys, or `nil` if no front matter is found.

### Custom loaders

Once a front matter is matched from a string, it is loaded as if it were a YAML text. However, you can also implement your own loaders. They just need to implement a `call(string)` method. You would use it like the following:

```ruby
json_loader = ->(string) { JSON.load(string) }

# For a file
FrontMatterParser::Parser.parse_file('example.md', loader: json_loader)

# For a string
FrontMatterParser::Parser.new(:md, loader: json_loader).parse(string)
```

## Release Policy

`front_matter_parser` follows the principles of [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/).

## To Do

* Add more known syntaxes.
* Allow configuration of global front matter delimiters. It would be easy, but I'm not sure if too useful.
* Allow different formats (as JSON). Again, I'm not sure if it would be very useful.

## Other ruby front matter parsers

* [front-matter](https://github.com/zhaocai/front-matter.rb) Can parse YAML front matters with single line comments delimiters. YAML must be correctly indented.
* [ruby_front_matter](https://github.com/F-3r/ruby_front_matter) Can parse JSON front matters and can configure front matter global delimiters, but does not accept comment delimiters.
